            <p>Seattle's most popular fish snack is now swimming to a store near you! Charlie McMannis was a fishmonger at Seattle's famous Pike Place Fish Market. One day after a hard day of entertaining tourists with his fish throwing skills he stopped by the Pike Place Bakery. That day he was served by Margarette LePain, a talented french chef. They shared a love of fish and cookies, and soon married. Each day, Charlie would go off to work to throw fish, and when he'd open up his lunch pail he'd find a love note from his wife in the form of beautifully frosted salmon cookies. Charlie bagan to share his fishy treeats with his friends, and soon they requested order after order of these unique fishy confections. Before long, Chalrlie and Margrette had more order than they could manage in their little apartment, and moved into their famous location at the Pike Place Market. Hailed by Fish and Wine Magazine as the "best end to a meal, salmon cookies are available at five locations worldwide, and can be ordered straight to your home."
